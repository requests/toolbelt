Contributing to this project
============================

Checklist
---------

#. All potential contributors must read the :ref:`code-of-conduct` and follow
   it

#. Fork the repository on `GitHub`_ or `GitLab`_

#. Create a new branch, e.g., ``git checkout -b bug/12345``

#. Fix the bug and add tests (if applicable [#]_, see :ref:`how-to-add-tests`)

#. Run the tests (see :ref:`how-to-run-tests` below)

#. Add documentation (as necessary) for your change

#. Build the documentation to check for errors and formatting (see
   :ref:`how-to-build-the-docs` below)

#. Add yourself to the :file:`AUTHORS.rst` (unless you're already there)

#. Commit it. Follow these rules in your commit message:

   * Keep the subject line under 50 characters

   * Use an imperative verb to start the commit

   * Use an empty line between the subject and the message

   * Describe the *why* in detail in the message portion of the commit

   * Wrap the lines of the message at 72 characters

   * Add the appropriate "Closes #12345" syntax to autoclose the issue it
     fixed (if it closes an issue)

   * See :ref:`example-commit-message` below

#. Push it to your fork

#. Create a request for us to merge your contribution

After this last step, it is possible that we may leave feedback in the form of
review comments. When addressing these comments, you can follow two
strategies:

* Amend/rebase your changes into an existing commit

* Create a new commit with a different message [#]_ describing the changes in
  that commit and push it to your branch

This project is not opinionated about which approach you should prefer.  We
only ask that you are aware of the following:

* Neither GitHub nor GitLab notifies us that you have pushed new changes. A
  friendly ping is encouraged

* If you continue to use the same branch that you created the request from,
  both GitHub and GitLab will update the request on the website. You do
  **not** need to create a new request for the new changes.

.. _how-to-add-tests:

How To Add Tests
----------------

We use `pytest`_ to run tests and to simplify how we write tests. If you're
fixing a bug in an existing please find tests for that module or feature and
add to them. Most tests live in the ``tests`` directory. If you're adding a
new feature in a new submodule, please create a new module of test code. For
example, if you're adding a submodule named ``foo`` then you would create
``tests/test_foo.py`` which will contain the tests for the ``foo`` submodule.

.. _how-to-run-tests:

How To Run The Tests
--------------------

Run the tests in this project using `tox`_.  Before you run the tests, ensure
you have installed tox either using your system package manager (e.g., apt,
yum, etc.), or your preferred python installer (e.g., pip).

Then run the tests on at least Python 2.7 and Python 3.x, e.g.,

.. code::

    $ tox -e py27,py34

Finally run one, or both, of the flake8 style enforcers, e.g.,

.. code::

    $ tox -e py27-flake8
    # or
    $ tox -e py34-flake8

It is preferable if you run both to catch syntax errors that might occur in
Python 2 or Python 3 (based on how familiar you are with the common subset of
language from both).

Tox will manage virtual environments and dependencies for you so it will be
the only dependency you need to install to contribute to this project.

.. _how-to-build-the-docs:

How To Build The Documentation
------------------------------

To build the docs, you need to ensure tox is installed and then you may run

.. code::

    $ tox -e docs

This will build the documentation into ``docs/_build/html``. If you then run

.. code::

    $ python2.7 -m SimpleHTTPServer
    # or
    $ python3.4 -m http.server

from that directory, you can view the docs locally at http://localhost:8000/.

.. _example-commit-message:

Example Commit Message
----------------------

::

    Allow users to use the frob when uploading data

    When uploading data with FooBar, users may need to use the frob method
    to ensure that pieces of data are not munged.

    Closes #1234567

Releasing a new version
-----------------------

#. Prepare the release pull request

   * In ``requests_toolbelt/__init__.py``, bump the version number

   * In ``HISTORY.rst``, include noteworthy changes under the relevant sections

   * Open a pull request with the above changes, and make any changes required
     to get it approved

#. "Squash and merge" the pull request in GitHub, which will give you a release
   commit

#. Tag the release with that commit:

   * Create the tag: ``git tag -s -a $VERSION -m "Release v$VERSION"``

   * Push it the main repository (not you fork!): ``git push <remote> --tags``

#. Upload it on PyPI with ``tox -e release``

#. [Optional] Announce it where relevant (social media, GitHub issues...)

Footnotes
---------

.. [#] You might not need tests if you're updating documentation, fixing a
       typo, or updating a docstring. If you're fixing a bug, please add
       tests.

.. [#] If each commit has the same message, the reviewer may ask you to
       squash your commits or may squash them for you and perform a manual
       merge.
