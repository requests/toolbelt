requests toolbelt
=================

This is a collection of utilities that some users of python-requests might need
but do not belong in requests proper. The library is actively maintained by
members of the requests core development team, and so reflects the
functionality most requested by users of the requests library.

To get an overview of what the library contains, consult the :ref:`user <user>`
documentation.
