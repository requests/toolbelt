.. versionadded:: 0.6.0

There are two ways to use this library.

If you're using requests directly, you can use code like:
    >>> import requests
    >>> import ssl
    >>> from requests.packages.urllib3.contrib import appengine as ul_appengine
    >>> from requests_toolbelt.adapters import appengine
    >>> s = requests.Session()
    >>> if ul_appengine.is_appengine_sandbox():
    ...    s.mount('http://', appengine.AppEngineAdapter())
    ...    s.mount('https://', appengine.AppEngineAdapter())

If you depend on external libraries which use requests, you can use code like:
    >>> from requests_toolbelt.adapters import appengine
    >>> appengine.monkeypatch()
which will ensure all requests.Session objects use AppEngineAdapter properly.
